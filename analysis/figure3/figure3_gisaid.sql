-- Based on the sequence submission date, calculate the proportion of high-quality sequences reported by each country from 2020 to 2023
-- GISAID database: Proportion of high-quality sequences (length above 29000nt and Ns â‰¤5%) for each country in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 by submission year
-- Requirements: Complete sampling dates, sampling date less than or equal to submission date. Countries are determined based on the "Location" field
